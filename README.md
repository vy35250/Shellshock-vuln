# Shellshock-vuln
Shellshock, also known as the Bash bug, is a critical vulnerability in the Bash shell.

It affects all operating systems (Linux and Unix based), which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on a vulnerable system by sending specially crafted environment variables to a Bash-based application.

It is a severe threat to the system and causes extreme data breaches.
